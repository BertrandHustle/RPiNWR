1. _truncate should take a data structure like the following:

[(msg, c)(msg, c)(msg, c)]

and return a single "best" message:
(msg, c)

using the distance function in SAME

2. distance function should ONLY calculate bitwise distance, not byte and bit

3. We want a class for these SAME messages like the following:

Class SAME_Parts:
  a = message_parts, confidences, timestamps
  b = distances
  c = aggregated message, confidence
  d = avgmsg()
    1. truncate
    2. originator code = WXR, CIV, etc.
    3. etc. (rest of message parts)

4. rewrite _truncate test to accomodate above changes
